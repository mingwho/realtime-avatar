# Realtime Avatar - Project Status

**Last Updated:** November 16, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 4 Code Complete ✅ (Deployment Blocked)  
**Performance:** 2x RTF (near real-time generation)

## 🎉 Latest Achievement: Phase 4 Full Conversation Pipeline!

**Date:** November 16, 2025

### Phase 4 Code Complete ✅

Successfully implemented end-to-end conversational avatar system:

**Components Delivered:**
- ✅ Conversation pipeline (ASR → LLM → TTS → Video)
- ✅ FastAPI endpoints (/transcribe, /chat, /conversation)
- ✅ Web UI with push-to-talk voice recording
- ✅ Hybrid deployment architecture (local web + remote GPU)
- ✅ Docker containerization for all services
- ✅ Deployment automation scripts

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
User Voice → Whisper ASR → GPT-4 → XTTS TTS → Ditto Video → User
```

**Performance Target:**
- Full conversation turn: ~35s for 17s audio (2x RTF)
- Voice recognition: Real-time
- LLM response: 2-5s
- Voice + video generation: ~30s

### Deployment Status: Blocked by Infrastructure

**Issue:** GCP L4 instance disk (49GB) insufficient for Phase 4
- Docker images: 25.5GB (17.5GB GPU + 8GB runtime)
- Model downloads: 2-3GB (XTTS, Whisper)
- Build cache: 5-10GB
- **Required:** 100GB+ disk

**Resolution Options:**
1. Resize GCP disk to 100GB
2. Use pre-downloaded model volumes
3. Test locally with smaller model variants
