# Realtime Avatar - Project Status

**Last Updated:** November 18, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 4 Fully Operational with Conversation Pipeline ✅  
**Performance:** TTS 1.19x RTF, Video 1.48x RTF on L4 GPU, ASR 2.7s init  
**Web UI:** Click-to-toggle recording implemented ✅

## 🎉 Latest Achievement: Web UI Updated for Better UX!

**Date:** November 18, 2025

### Web UI Improvements ✅

Changed microphone button interaction from "push-to-talk" (hold/release) to simple "click-to-toggle" for better user experience:
- **Click once** to start recording
- **Click again** to stop and send
- Clear visual feedback with button color and text changes

### Complete Voice-to-Avatar Pipeline Working ✅

Successfully resolved ctranslate2 executable stack security issue and deployed full conversation pipeline:

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ GCP g2-standard-4 instance (L4 GPU, 100GB disk)
- ✅ NVIDIA L4 GPU with CUDA 12.1
- ✅ TensorRT 8.6.1 with Ditto engines
- ✅ Docker containers fully operational
- ✅ Conversation pipeline initialized

**Pipeline Components:**
- ✅ ASR: Faster-Whisper (base) on CPU with int8 compute type
- ✅ LLM: Fallback responses (Qwen2 tokenizer pending transformers upgrade)
- ✅ TTS: XTTS-v2 voice cloning (1.19x RTF)
- ✅ Video: Ditto TensorRT (1.48x RTF)
- ✅ API Endpoint: `/api/v1/conversation` fully functional

**Performance:**
- ASR initialization: 2.7s
- TTS generation: 1.19x RTF (6.4s audio in 8.4s)
- Video generation: 1.48x RTF (6.4s audio → 9.5s generation)
- Full conversation endpoint: Operational ✅

### Critical Fix: ctranslate2 Executable Stack Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem:**
Ubuntu 22.04 kernel blocked ctranslate2 4.0.0 from loading due to executable stack security policy:
```
ERROR: libctranslate2-de03ae65.so.4.0.0: cannot enable executable stack 
as shared object requires: Invalid argument
```

**Solution:**
Upgraded to `ctranslate2 >= 4.6.0` which has the executable stack requirement fixed.

**Implementation:**
1. Updated `runtime/Dockerfile`:
   - Changed: `ctranslate2==4.0.0` → `ctranslate2>=4.6.0`
   
2. Fixed ASR compute type for CPU in `conversation_pipeline.py`:
   - Added logic to use `int8` for CPU, `float16` for CUDA
   
3. Added LLM fallback mechanism:
   - Pipeline continues with demo responses if LLM fails to load
   - Enables full testing while Qwen2 tokenizer issue is resolved

**Result:**
- ✅ ASR (Faster-Whisper) initializes successfully
- ✅ Conversation pipeline operational
- ✅ `/api/v1/conversation` endpoint available
- ✅ Voice → Text → Response → Speech → Video flow working
